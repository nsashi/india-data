The data in this folder was obtained from www.imd.gov.in/section/hydro/distrainfall/webrain/.
According to another website which has this data, imd.gov.in released this data only
after an RTI enquiry.

The released data was formatted text files which was not very suitable for analysis
on computers.

The program pack-data.py in this folder parses all the data and packs them in excel
files (statewise, with sheets for different districts).
